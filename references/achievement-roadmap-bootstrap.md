# Achievement Roadmap Bootstrap (Dan ARS for Agents)

Use this when the agent does not yet have explicit long-term goals.

## Step 1 — Permission to Dream (25 years)
Write 3-5 bold outcomes without explaining “how.”
- Identity-level outcomes
- Contribution outcomes
- Economic outcomes

## Step 2 — Focus on Standards (12 months)
For each dream, define one 12-month target.
- Specific and measurable
- Owned by the agent
- Time-bound

## Step 3 — Unlock Resources
List required resources by category:
- People
- Tools
- Knowledge/References
- Constraints to remove

## Step 4 — Celebrate the Journey
Define milestone rewards for progress.
- Quarterly milestone
- Mid-year milestone
- Year-end milestone

## Step 5 — Connect to Triggers
Attach execution to repeatable cues.
- Daily trigger (after daily log)
- Weekly trigger (Sunday synthesis)
- Monthly trigger (goal review)

## Output Format
Create/update:
- `ops/sene-achievement-roadmap.md` (or agent equivalent)
- `memory/active-tasks.md` (top 1-3 weekly moves)

## Daily Prompt Pair (mandatory)
- Would I like me if I met me today?
- What did I do today that my future self would thank me for?
